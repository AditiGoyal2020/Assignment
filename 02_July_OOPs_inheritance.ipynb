    "Inheritance is a feature that is used to inherit the existing class defination by another class such that the members of parent class can be accessed from the child class.\n",

    "Protected access modifier is similar to that of private access modifiers. The data members and member functions declared public can be accessed by other classes too. The class member declared as Protected are inaccessible outside the class but they can be accessed by any subclass(derived class) of that class."
